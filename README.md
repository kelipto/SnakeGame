Retro Snake Game with GUI - An Object-Oriented Programming ProjectRetro Snake Game with GUI - An Object-Oriented Programming Project
Developed a modern take on the classic Snake game using Java and Swing for the GUI. The game features move-based mechanics and includes two different modes for the Snake: defensive and offensive, each offering different challenges and strategies. Advanced features include the ability to save the game state and reload it later, and a comprehensive JUnit test suite to ensure game reliability. The game also incorporates the Observer design pattern for efficient state management between the game logic and the user interface.Developed a modern take on the classic Snake game using Java and Swing for the GUI.
